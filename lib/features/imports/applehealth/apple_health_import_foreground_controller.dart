/// Starts (and detects) the Apple Health import's foreground service — the
/// Flutter analogue of Kotlin's `AppleHealthImportWorkController`, which
/// enqueues the unique `apple_health_import` work and observes its `WorkInfo`.
///
/// WorkManager can run any number of workers side by side. `flutter_foreground_task`
/// cannot: the app declares exactly ONE `ForegroundService` in the manifest, and
/// `startService` throws `ServiceAlreadyStartedException` when it is already up.
/// So an Apple Health import and a GPS activity recording can never hold it at
/// the same time, and the collision has to be refused explicitly in both
/// directions:
///
///   * an import refuses to start while a recording owns the service
///     ([AppleHealthImportLaunch.serviceBusy]);
///   * the recording controller keeps its own `startService` path untouched — it
///     already refreshes an existing service instead of double-starting, and the
///     import never steals a service it did not start.
///
/// [kAppleHealthImportKeyActive] is what tells the two apart: it is written
/// before the import's service comes up and cleared when its task ends, so a
/// *running* service with the flag set is our import (re-attach), and one
/// without it belongs to something else (refuse).
