/// Arms an exact Android alarm that wakes the app at the trigger time, mirroring
/// the Kotlin `HydrationReminderAlarmManager`.
///
/// This is the faithful model: the alarm wakes a background isolate, which
/// re-reads today's progress and *then* decides whether to notify. A
/// pre-scheduled notification cannot do that — its body is fixed at schedule
/// time, and it fires even after the user has already hit the goal.
///
/// [callback] must be a top-level or static function annotated with
/// `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`: the plugin resolves it to a raw callback handle
/// and invokes it in a fresh isolate, so a closure would not survive.
///
/// `rescheduleOnReboot` makes Android persist the alarm across a reboot, which
/// is what the Kotlin `HydrationReminderBootReceiver` did by hand. The alarm
/// re-fires after boot, the callback recomputes, and the chain continues.
