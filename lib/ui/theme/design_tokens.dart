/// The measurements the app is laid out on: the spacing grid, the corner-radius
/// scale, the emphasis alphas, and the fixed component metrics.
///
/// Colour and type already had a home ([AppColors], [AppTypography]) and charts
/// got one in `chart_tokens.dart`. Everything in THIS file was, until now, typed
/// straight into the widget that needed it — 563 `SizedBox` literals, 481
/// `EdgeInsets`, 71 hand-written alphas, and the card radius written out twice in
/// two files that could have disagreed at any moment without anyone noticing.
///
/// **Plain constants, not a [ThemeExtension].** `ChartTokens` is an extension
/// because its colours must derive from the live `ColorScheme` — dynamic colour
/// and AMOLED make a hard-coded grey wrong. A gap of 12 logical pixels is 12
/// logical pixels in every theme, so an extension would buy nothing and cost a
/// `Theme.of(context)` lookup at every call site. The layout constants at the
/// bottom of `chart_tokens.dart` are declared the same way for the same reason.
///
/// These values are the design system's, not this file's: they mirror
/// `tokens/spacing.css` and `tokens/shape.css` in the **OpenVitals design-system
/// repository** (a sibling checkout — it used to live in `design/` here). Where
/// that system and this code disagree about a *scale*, the design system wins;
/// where they disagree about a colour or a type slot, the code wins, because the
/// palette is contrast-audited and ships. Its `readme.md` states the same rule
/// from the other side.
