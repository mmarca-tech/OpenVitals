# Body Metrics

The body feature owns period-based detail screens for body measurement and composition metrics read from Health Connect.

## Implemented Metrics

Body metric detail screens currently cover:

- Weight.
- Height.
- BMI.
- Body fat.
- Lean mass.
- Basal metabolic rate.
- Bone mass.
- Body water mass.

BMI and FFMI-style context are derived from available measurements. Derived values should explain missing prerequisites instead of pretending the calculation is complete.

## Detail Pattern

Body metrics follow the canonical period-detail pattern:

- Day, week, month, and year ranges.
- Previous/next period navigation capped at the current period.
- Calendar selection and pull to refresh.
- Period charts, selected-day entries, statistics, comparisons, personal baselines, and data confidence.
- Entry lists that allow edit/delete only for OpenVitals-created records.
- Reorderable metric detail sections.

Manual body entry lives under `features/manualentry/body` and writes explicit user-entered records to Health Connect. The dashboard and body detail screens remain read-oriented.

## Data Boundaries

The body feature reads through `BodyRepository`. New body metric work should keep feature-specific formatting, cards, charts, and rows in `features/body`; shared components should only move out when another feature really reuses them.
