# Permissions

OpenVitals asks for permissions by purpose. The local app removes inherited network permissions during manifest merge and should not ship app-level `INTERNET`, network-state, or Wi-Fi-state permissions.

This page mirrors the current permission surface declared in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Cycle Tracking Read Permissions

Cycle data is sensitive. These permissions are grouped separately in onboarding and Settings so users can grant or skip them explicitly:

- `android.permission.health.READ_MENSTRUATION`
- `android.permission.health.READ_OVULATION_TEST`
- `android.permission.health.READ_CERVICAL_MUCUS`
- `android.permission.health.READ_BASAL_BODY_TEMPERATURE`
- `android.permission.health.READ_INTERMENSTRUAL_BLEEDING`
- `android.permission.health.READ_SEXUAL_ACTIVITY`

## Health Connect Write Permissions

Declared for explicit save, edit/delete, recording, and supported import workflows. Write permissions should be requested only when a workflow needs them:

- `android.permission.health.WRITE_STEPS`

## Health Connect Access Modes

- `android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_HISTORY`: used when the user grants access to older records.
- `android.permission.health.READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND`: used where supported for background Health Connect reads.

## Android Runtime Permissions

- `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: required for reliable GPS activity recording.
- `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: declared with location access for Android permission compatibility.
- `android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`: used where Android requires activity-recognition access for recorded activity workflows.
- `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN`: used to find paired Bluetooth LE sensors for experimental activity recording.
- `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`: used to connect to paired Bluetooth LE sensors for experimental activity recording, and to a paired Garmin watch when syncing what it recorded.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: used for foreground activity recording and user-started import work.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`: marks long-running Apple Health imports as user-started data sync work.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION`: marks the recording service as location-based.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_HEALTH`: marks the recording service as health-related where Android supports it.
- `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE`: marks recording with connected Bluetooth LE devices where Android supports it.
- `android.permission.HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS`: supports higher-rate sensor access for activity recording on devices that expose it.
- `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: used for activity recording, Apple Health import progress, and reminder notifications.
- `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`: used to reschedule reminders after reboot or app update.

## Companion Device Permissions

Used only for [Garmin watch sync](../features/garmin-watch-sync.md). These are install-time grants with no runtime prompt of their own — the consent is the system **"Allow OpenVitals to access your watch?"** dialog shown while pairing. Declining that dialog is supported: the watch still pairs and still syncs, without the background priority described below.

- `android.permission.REQUEST_COMPANION_RUN_IN_BACKGROUND`: lets Android keep the app's process alive while the watch is nearby, so a file sync that runs for minutes is not killed halfway through.
- `android.permission.REQUEST_OBSERVE_COMPANION_DEVICE_PRESENCE`: lets Android tell the app when the watch comes into range, which is what triggers the priority boost above.
- `android.software.companion_device_setup` (a *feature* declaration, not a permission, and marked not required): without it Android refuses the association outright. Marked optional so the app still installs on devices with no companion support, where watch pairing falls back to a plain Bluetooth bond that syncs fine.

`REQUEST_COMPANION_USE_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND` is deliberately **not** declared: it governs background network use, and this app has no network permission at all.

## Removed Network Permissions

The manifest explicitly removes inherited network permissions from dependencies:

- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
- `android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`

These removals preserve the local app's internet-free boundary.

## File And Route Intents

OpenVitals can receive GPX, KML, KMZ, and FIT files through Android open/share intents so imported activities can be reviewed and saved to Health Connect. It can also import PMTiles and Mapsforge map packs from Settings for offline activity maps.

The app uses a local file provider to export route files, such as GPX or KMZ, to other apps.
